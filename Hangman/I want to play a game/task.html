<h2 style="text-align: center;">Guess the word</h2>

<p>At this stage, you will create a real game. It will be simple, but there will be two possible outcomes (you can see in the examples below how they look like). Let's first print a welcome message and then ask a player to guess the word we set for the game. If our player manages to guess the exact word, the game reports "win"; otherwise it will "hang" the player.</p>

<p>You should print <code>You survived!</code> if the user guessed the word and <code>You are hanged!</code> otherwise. By the way, the word <code>python</code> should be the correct word to win the game.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Input and output example</h2>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: python
You survived!</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: java
You are hanged!</code></pre>

<p>where <code>Guess the word:</code> is an input invitation message.</p>

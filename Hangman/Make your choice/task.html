<h2 style="text-align: center;">Guess a random word</h2>

<p>If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable: you already know the word, so it makes no sense to guess it. At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. This way, our game won't be just a one-time entertainment.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Input and output example</h2>

<p>Using the following word list: <code>'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code> ,  program the game to choose a random word from it. You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: python
You survived!</code></pre>

<p>In case the computer randomly chose <code>python</code> from the list.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: python
You are hanged!</code></pre>

<p>In case the computer randomly chose something other than <code>python</code> from the list.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word: C#
You are hanged!</code></pre>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Add the victory condition</h2>

<p>The recent version of the game is not as fun until we don't handle the player's victory. A player wins when all the letters are guessed and there are still some tries left (except the player uses his last try and actually guesses the word, he's lucky then!).</p>

<p>Notice that, in the previous stage, the user has only 8 attempts to guess letters. The number of attempts was decreasing despite the fact that the user guessed one of the hidden letters in the word! It needs to be changed - now the number of attempts should decrease only if there are no letters to uncover. And yes, if the word to guess is <code>-a-a</code> at the moment and the user printed <code>a</code> you should count this as a fail and reduce the number of attempts by 1 (later we'll fix it in favor of the user).</p>

<p>Print <code>No such letter in the word</code> if the word guessed by the program doesn't contain this letter.</p>

<p>Print <code>No improvements</code> if the guessed word contains this letter but the user tried this letter before.</p>

<p><strong>Attention!</strong>  Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</p>

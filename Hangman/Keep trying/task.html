<h2 style="text-align: center;">Letter by letter</h2>

<p>Let's make the game iterative. It's time to make it resemble the classical Hangman a bit more: a player should guess letters in the word instead of typing the entire word at once. If the player guesses a letter, it should be uncovered in the word. For now, start with the defeat case and add 8 tries to guess a letter that appears in the word. When the player runs out of attempts, the game ends.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Input and output example</h2>

<p>A player should have 8 tries and enter letters. If the letter doesn't occur in the word, the computer takes one try away, even if the user already inputted this letter before. If the player doesn't have any more attempts, the game should end and the program should show a losing message. Otherwise, the player can continue to input letters.</p>

<p>Notice that if a player has more tries but he actually guessed the word, it doesn't mean anything. Determining the winning conditions will be in the next stage, in this stage you should print how well user guesses the word on every user attempt to input a letter. Try to match your input with the example below (it is important for testing to print a new line before printing guessed letters).</p>

<p>Also, use the following word list: <code>'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code> so that your program can be tested more reliably.</p>

<p><strong>Attention!</strong>  Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Polishing the gameplay</h2>

<p>Now that we are done with the basics, let's work on some details.</p>

<p>Notice that in the previous stage if the user entered the same letter twice, the program reduced the number of attempts regardless if this was a correct letter or not. But it is not fair to the user, isn't it? He gains no additional information about the situation on the field yet the program still reduces his attempts count. This time if the user enters the same letter twice then the program should output <code>You already typed this letter</code> .</p>

<p>Also, you should check if the user prints an English lowercase letter or not. If not, the program should print <code>It is not an ASCII lowercase letter</code> . </p>

<p>Also, you should check if the user printed exactly one letter. If not, the program should print <code>You should print a single letter</code> . Remember that zero is also not one!</p>

<p>Note, that all these three errors should not reduce attempts count.</p>

<p><strong>Attention!</strong>  Please, make sure that your program's output formatting precisely follows the example output formatting. Pay attention to the empty lines between tries and in the end.</p>

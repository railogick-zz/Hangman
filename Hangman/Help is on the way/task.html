<h2 style="text-align: center;">Guess a word with a hint</h2>

<p>Now our game has become quite hard, and your chances of guessing the word depend on the size of the list. In our case with four words, there is only a 25% chance, so let's have mercy on the player and add a hint for them.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Input and output example</h2>

<p>As in the previous stage, you should use the following word list: <code>'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'</code></p>

<p>Let the game show the <strong>first 3 letters</strong> after the computer chose a word from the list.<br>
Hidden letters should be replaced with dashes (<code>"-"</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word jav-: java
You survived!</code></pre>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">H A N G M A N
Guess the word pyt---: pytnoh
You are hanged!</code></pre>
